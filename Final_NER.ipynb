    "Physician: Hello Sarah, thank you for coming in. How can I help you today?\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient: Hi, Dr. Lee. I'm not really sure where to start. I just feel... on edge all the time. I'm constantly worried, and it's starting to wear me down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physician: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about this 'worry'? What sort of things are on your mind?\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient: Honestly, everything. It can be small things, like being late for an appointment, or big things, like my parents' health or job security. My mind just seems to find something to fixate on, and then it spirals. I imagine the worst-case scenario for everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physician: And how long has this been going on?\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient: It's been there in the background for years, I think, but it's gotten really bad over the last six months. It feels like I can't switch my brain off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physician: Are you experiencing any physical symptoms along with the mental anxiety?\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient: Yes, and that's what really prompted me to come in. I've been having moments where my heart starts racing for no reason, my palms get sweaty, and I feel a bit dizzy. Sometimes I have trouble falling asleep because my thoughts are racing. I'm also clenching my jaw constantly without realizing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physician: Those sound like panic attacks or at least significant physical manifestations of anxiety. How is this affecting your day-to-day life? Your work, your relationships?\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient: At work, I have trouble concentrating. I'll read the same email three times. I'm more irritable with my partner, and I've been turning down invitations to see friends because I just don't have the energy. I feel like I'm trapped in my own head.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physician: Thank you for sharing that, Sarah. It takes courage to talk about this. What you're describing sounds very much like Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. It's a very common and, importantly, a very treatable condition. You are not alone in this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient: A disorder? That sounds so serious. I thought I was just a 'worrier'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physician: It's a clinical term, but it just means that the worry has become persistent and severe enough to impact your quality of life. The good news is that we have excellent, evidence-based treatments. The two main pillars are therapy and medication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient: I'm a bit nervous about medication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physician: That's a very normal concern. A common and effective approach is Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, or CBT. It's a type of talk therapy that helps you identify and challenge those negative thought patterns. For medication, a class of drugs called SSRIs, like Sertraline, can be very effective at 'turning down the volume' on the anxiety, which can make therapy more effective. They are non-addictive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient: So I don't have to decide on medication today?\n",
    "\n",
    "Physician: Not at all. A great first step would be a referral to a therapist who specializes in CBT. I can give you a list of trusted colleagues. We can also schedule a follow-up with me in a month to see how you feel and to revisit the medication option then if you're still struggling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient: Okay. I like the idea of starting with therapy. It feels like a proactive step. Just talking about it has made me feel a little lighter, actually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physician: That's often the case. Recognizing the problem is the first and most important step. We'll get you the support you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient: Thank you, doctor. I really appreciate it.\n",
